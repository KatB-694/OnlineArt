<h2>McDonalds Releases Pokemon Themed Happy Meals Again, Local Dork is Ecstatic</h1>

<p>As a Pokemon nerd myself, upon discovery of these I knew I <strong>must</strong> get my hands on a couple Happy Meals soon before they are discontinued. These happy meals not only include a complementary pack of trading cards, but also 24 pack hourglasses + 12 wonder hourglasses for the new Pokemon TCG Pocket app. <em>(That is, per account by redeeming through McDonald’s rewards app.)</em> This is quite the pleasant surprise, considering as of writing this I’ll be passing a McDonald’s tomorrow on my way to school. <p/>

<p>What caught my eye the most, however, was when I spotted someone on the internet pulled a Miraidon card that is identical to my own copy I got myself a couple months back. I got this card when a coworker of my Dad’s went to Japan for a while and Dad asked if he could bring me back some authentic Pokemon souvenirs. He went above and beyond, and I was given an electric battle card pack, all in Japanese, with the cool Miriadon card in it. I now would <em>really</em> like a second one in english to be friends with the first Japanese card.</p>

<h2>Aforementioned Local Dork is Unsure She Completed Her Web Design Assignment Right</h2>

<p><q>Does downloading a Google Doc as a html file do the trick? Do I need a special coding software? Which one do I get? How do I view this file later if I wanted to?</q> These are only a few of the many questions local dork has about her assignment, weighing a good 15 points, due in 45 minutes. Most of those questions, however, have resolved themselves with time. But those that remain are listed above for the single person audience this file is directed to. <i>Please send a message through Canvas as opposed to email if you can.</i></p>
